All the files should go to their right directories. Just unzip it to your drive that has Quake2 on it and make sure that "Use Folder Names" is checked. If you have Q2
in a different directory unzip the files to X:\(quake 2 directory)\baseq2\players\mrfrost.

Model description: Uh, it's a snowman.  Not just any snowman an evil snowman :) If you don't know what a snowman is then there is something seriously wrong with you. 

Other info: First of all, this is my first model I have done so it was a "learning experience".  I thought it wouldn't be that hard to do a snowman for my first model. Not 
until about half way through it did I find out that somebody already made a snowman. Doh! Well this is a completely different kind of snowman (whatever that means). Also I already know some of the things that aren't that great on it. Some of the animations look a little wacky but thats ok isn't it? I am not that great of a skinner and the ctf skins
were just added at the last minute.
