Time Spent: too much
Description:	If you are one of those who is afraid of clowns, I have some bad news
	for you: Jack's back.  If you don't know who Jack is, you don't want to.  He's
	the psychotic Jack in the Box player model for Quake2.  But now he's back, with
	a lower polycount, better skins, better animations, sounds, and the ever so
	popular VWEP support.
Installation:	Unzip all the files into a subdirectory called "Jack" in your players
	directory.  You can then select Jack in the player setup menu in Quake 2.
Skins:		I can never get enough skins for this model (until I run out of HD
	space).  I have included SOME skins for the model, but they're not enough.  I
	tried to get as many skins as I could before I decided to release the model,
	but no one sent me any.  However, I'd still like to get a bunch of skins, and
	if I get a lot, I'll probably make up a skin pak for the model.

	SO SEND ME YOUR SKINS!
Sounds:		The sounds are just plain loud and obnoxious.  They go great with the
	model.  Special thanks to my dad for the crazy laughing sounds.
Comments:	Send me your comments.  Again, send me your comments.  I usually don't
	receive a lot of comments for my models.  I like to hear what people think
	about my work and what they could suggest for my future models.
	
	SO SEND ME YOUR COMMENTS!

	Oh, and the fact that the bump1, drown1, gurp1, and gurp2 sounds were left out
	was not a mistake, so there's no need to point that out to me.

-ENJOY JACK-
